# Apple-Analysis-Data-Engineering
## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Databricks Spark for processing apple-related data. Utilizing the Factory Design Pattern, it provides a modular and flexible approach to handle various data formats efficiently. The project encompasses ETL pipelines, business transformations, and advanced data processing techniques using PySpark.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

### `apple_analysis.py`

- **Purpose**: Contains the core logic for analyzing apple-related datasets.
- **Functions**:
  - Data loading
  - Data processing
  - Data visualization

### `extractor.py`

- **Purpose**: Handles the extraction of data from external sources.
- **Functions**:
  - Connects to and retrieves data from various sources (CSV, Parquet, etc.)
  - Prepares data for further processing

### `loader.py`

- **Purpose**: Manages the loading of processed data into target systems.
- **Functions**:
  - Inserts data into databases or data warehouses
  - Ensures data integrity and accuracy

### `loader_factory.py`

- **Purpose**: Implements the Factory Design Pattern to create data loader instances.
- **Functions**:
  - Creates loader instances based on data type or target system
  - Provides flexibility in data loading

### `reader_factory.py`

- **Purpose**: Implements the Factory Design Pattern to create data reader instances.
- **Functions**:
  - Provides reader instances based on data format or source
  - Facilitates seamless data extraction

### `transformer.py`

- **Purpose**: Contains logic for data transformation.
- **Functions**:
  - Data cleaning
  - Data enrichment
  - Other transformation processes

## Project Overview

In this project, Databricks and PySpark are utilized to build and manage ETL pipelines:

- **Data Sources**: 
  - CSV, Parquet, and Delta Tables.

- **Factory Pattern**:
  - Implemented for versatile reader and loader classes, promoting modularity and maintainability.

- **Business Transformation**:
  - PySpark DataFrame API and Spark SQL are used for complex data transformations and business logic.

- **Data Loading**:
  - **Data Lake**: For scalable storage and processing.
  - **Data Lakehouse**: Combining the benefits of data lakes and data warehouses.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Broadcast Join**:
  - Optimizes join operations with large datasets.

- **Partitioning and Bucketing**:
  - Enhances query performance and data management.

- **SparkSession**:
  - Manages the Spark application lifecycle.

- **Window Functions**:
  - Utilizes LAG and LEAD for advanced analytics.

- **Delta Tables**:
  - Leverages ACID transactions and scalable metadata handling.
